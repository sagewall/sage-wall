A custom python module was developed that calculates change in recorded gamma and provides functions for preprocessing the magnetometer data. Tools in the python toolbox were created to calculate statistics on the distribution of magnetometer readings and assess survey coverage. Other tools were developed to display interpolated surfaces of raw magnetic data and the first derivative of this surface. Testing of the models and tool outputs was performed at Biscayne Bay National Park on known submerged archaeological sites.",
